Cargo Freight Managment System


	This is a report about the Cargo Freight Managment System and the steps that were taken to complete this project and the difficulties that I faced through this project. Also there will be an explanation about what this program does. Basically, There are stations and there are freight cars that pass through these stations. Freight cars carry containers and containers come in different types such as: normal, heavy, refrigerated,and liquid containers. Through these stations freight cars can load or unload different containers onto them.These freight cars require minimum amounts of fuel to go from a station to another station.


	In this program everything from fuel required for a freight car to go from a station to a different station is calculated as well as how many containers can a freight car carry from a station to another station depending on the containers type and weight. Each station has a unique ID as well as containers and freight cars. Fuel of a freight car is calculated before each trip to see if there is enough fuel for the next trip. Before each trip there can be a maximum number of containers connected to a freight car and the amount of maximum containers can identified depending on the weight of each container and its type.


	There were many problems that I personally faced going through this project such as the coding part were I had some problems connecting some parts of codes with their classes and some specific imports which I needed to complete the program as well as some some lines of code that were unreachable. I’ve gotten some help from some of my classmates and mostly I got help from Stackoverflow which is a website were a lot programmers connect through to ask questions or provide others with help. I personally used pycharm as my code editor as it is the IDE im most comfortable to use. There are still some parts of the program that are not complete that im not capable of succssesfully completing as I do not have the knowledge required to do so even after trying different approaches to solving some of the problems faced.


	Doing this project has helped me learn a lot of new statements and things that will be helpful with my future projects. It was defenitly hard as this was my first project but with some help I’d say I’ve done a pretty good job with what I have done. I have learned and documented a lot of the new statements and commands that I used in this project to learn, practice ,and master. Overall, this was a good experience as it made me get a step closer to becoming a better programmer.
